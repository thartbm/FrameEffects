# FrameEffects

This is a set of psychophysics experiments to probe the requirements for belongingness of the probes "in" the frame, such the the motion of the frame affects the perceived position of the probes. In short: when do we see an illusion, and when don't we.

We test this in two tasks where the spatial relations are changed, two tasks where the temopral relations are changed, and two tasks where the motion of the frame is changed. Furthermore, we can test the strength of the illusion over time, as the full set of tasks takes most participants ~1.5 hours and we embedded some standard stimuli in the tasks where this was possible.
