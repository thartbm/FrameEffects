# Frame Effects

This is a set of psychophysics experiments to probe the requirements for belongingness of the probes "in" the frame, such the the motion of the frame affects the perceived position of the probes. In short: when do we see an illusion, and when don't we.

We test this in two tasks where the spatial relations are changed, two tasks where the temopral relations are changed, and two tasks where the motion of the frame is changed. Furthermore, we can test the strength of the illusion over time, as the full set of tasks takes most participants ~1.5 hours and we embedded some standard stimuli in the tasks where this was possible.

The experiments are coded in PsychoPy and while they are only meant to run on one particular setup, the code was meant to be both setup-agnostic and modular such that you should be able to run it with minor modifications or be able to create your experiment by changing the code as you want.

There is some R code as well, that can be used to get a first glance at the data. For now, the data is not available however.
