# Frame Effects

This code repository goes with a set of psychophysics experiments testing the dependence of the frame effect on spatial and temporal relations between the frame and probes, as well as on motion signals present in the task.

The repo is an R Studio project with a notebook. This notebook downloads other necessary files (mostly data) and reproduces all analyses, statistics and data figures.

There is no `renv` (yet) in this project, but it was run on R 4.5.1 with mostly up to date packages that were all from CRAN.

The accompanying data repository is: <https://osf.io/ufzsq>
